# Cryptor
A pure C++ encryption-decryption software that leverages multithreading for fast-paced encryption-decryption of Files.

## Key Features - 
- 🧵 Multithreading Support - Implements concurrent execution using std::thread to handle parallel tasks like data encryption,                                logging, and file operations, improving performance and responsiveness.
- 🗂️ Thread-Safe File Operations - Ensures simultaneous reads/writes are handled safely with proper synchronization mechanisms                                     (like mutexes or locks).
- 🔗 Shared Memory / Interprocess Communication (IPC) - Uses OS-level concepts such as shared memory segments or file-based                                                             synchronization to allow safe data exchange between processes —                                                                 simulating real-world system-level applications.
